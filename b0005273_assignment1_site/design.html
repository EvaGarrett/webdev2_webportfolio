  <div class="column3"> This is one of the most recent projects I have worked on. This poster was aimed at new coming first years, my aim was to give them some advice for starting off in college, i based my idea around 'balance', and how important it is to balance and manage yoir time wisey to get the most out of college but also to enjoy it! Here is my piece.

	  The project that I am currently working on is based around a poster design for an upcoming Hip-Hop festival, I am only in the development stage for this poster but I am hoping for a great outcome for this project. As my poster is not complete, i will share some images with you that are my inspiration for this project so far.
